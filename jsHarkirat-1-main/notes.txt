Js is a single threaded and syncronus
we can make it asyncronus by using asyncronus function

debouncing - delayed sending out request, to save and reduce number of backed calls

High level dom element
1)document.createElement
2)document.appendChild
3)element.setAttribute

Todo application using DOM manipulation with better solution

Dont clear the DOM upfront, update it based on what has changed.
Question is, how does it calculated what all has changed?
Has a todo been marked as complete?
Has a todo been removed from the backend;

By remembering the old todos in a variable (Virtual DOM)

What is a database:-

Good question to have at the point
    Why dont we let the user hit the database directly?
    What extra does the http server provide exactly?

    1) Database were are created using protocols that browsers dont understand.
    2) Database dont have granual access as a first class citizen. Very hard to do user specific access in them.
    3) There are some database (firebase) that let you get rid of the https server and try their best to provide granola access.

Database usually allow access to 4 primitives 
    1)Create Data
    2)Read Data
    3)Update Data
    4)Delete Data
    Popularly known as CURD

What is Database:-

    Lets see thr API for the mongoose library
    Eventually, we'll be using prisma (which is the industry standatd way of doing this)

    In mongoose, first you have to define the schema
    This sounds counter inuttive since mongodb is schemaless?

    That is true, but mongoosemakes you define schema for things like auto completitions/Validating data before it goes in the DB to make setAttribute
    you're doing things right Schemaless dbs can be very dangereous, using schema in mongo makes it slightly less Deangereous.
